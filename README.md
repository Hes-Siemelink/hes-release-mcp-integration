### 1. Configure your `hosts` file

Add the following to `/etc/hosts` or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` (sudo / administrator permissions
required):

    127.0.0.1 container-registry

### 2. Start the Release environment:

```commandline
cd dev-environment
docker compose up -d --build
```

### 3. Build & publish the plugin

Run the build script

**Unix / macOS**

```commandline
sh build.sh --upload
```

**Windows**

```commandline
build.bat --upload
```

### 3. Set up credentials

Put your API keys into [setup/secrets.xlvals](setup/secrets.xlvals).

Use the example file as a base:

```commandline
cp setup/secrets.xlvals.example setup/secrets.xlvals
```

Then edit the file and add your keys.

### 4. Upload demo templates

Run the following command to upload the demo templates to the local Release instance:

```commandline

```

### Demo time!
